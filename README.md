TiHighlight
===========

This is TiHighlight. See the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcCiVhEdWcE) demo.

It should work on both Android and iOS. iOS use as is in the video. For
android tapping the Preview tab executes the code, when other options
are accessed via the Android menu.

Still experimental. Tell me how it goes.
